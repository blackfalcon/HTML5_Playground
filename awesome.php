				<p>Ok, this was pretty awesome to play with.  I had a new project where I needed to develop a 'player' of sorts.  In the process of developing the 'prototype' I decided that I would not use any actual graphics and see how far I got.  Here is the result.  </p>
				<p>At the time of posting this, the UI has been optimized for Webkit browsers (Chrome/Safari).  Firefox is ok, but it can be better.  At this time, this is NOT supported in IE.  Any IE.  In fact, I haven't even looked at this in IE.  </p>

				<footer>Download file will be made available in the foreseeable future.</footer>
